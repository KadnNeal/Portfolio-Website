                    This is where I am currently operating as a field engineer, at the Meta Mesa AZ data center. 
                    This is the biggest project I have been on, it being a 1 billion dollar project. At this project
                    I have been leading my peers in the field and performing acceptance testing at an extraordinary
                    rate. This includes data halls with RPPs, rack bus, breakers, switchboards, switches, cables,
                    transformers, etc.

                    The Intel Fab 52 & 56, a semi conductor factory, wasthe first site I operated 
                    at as a field engineer. I started here in June of 2023 learning a mulitide of things 
                    such as electrical theory, subsation design, electrical design, and how 
                    to perform electrical testing. My testing mostly consisted of LV breakers, MV breakers,
                    switches, switchboards, transformers, etc.

                    In January of 2024 I worked as a field engineer over at the Microsoft data center in
                    Goodyear. Here I was sharper than ever and was able to carry out tasks as needed 
                    for my project manager as a field lead. Here is where most of the concepts of electrical 
                    theory got solidified and I was able to troubleshoot just about anything to get the correct
                    test results for transformers, breakers, switchboards. I was also able to lead and teach my 
                    peers in problem solving on the field.

                <p>
                    After the begginng of my field engineer career at Intel I moved over to an Aligned Energy
                    data center. At this data center I was able to take up more responsibilities such as 
                    single handedly filling out test data sheets to send to the cutsomer, interacting 
                    with the customer, organizing work, managing other employees as a feild lead, and much 
                    more. Here I was able to apply the electrical theory I was constantly learning to 
                    problem solve and troubleshoot the testing of electrical equipment.
